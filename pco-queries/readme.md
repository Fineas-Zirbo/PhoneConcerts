Steps:

1. Make sure you have the user and an empty db with name db_pco. (`0_initial_scripts.sql` or https://bitbucket.org/phoneconcerts/pco-docker/src/master/). 
    If you already have a DB, drop it. You can just uncomment the first line of the file before running the script.
    
2. Import `1_create_tables.sql` to have an empty clean db.

3. Import `2_test_concerts.sql` if you want to have some concerts in the db.
